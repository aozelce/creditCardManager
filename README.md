### Problem:

Managing multiple credit cards can be quite the challenge. Each card offers different benefitsâ€”some give more points for travel, while others are great for groceries. As the number of credit cards increases, keeping track of different due dates and benefits becomes difficult. Without a unified system to manage this information, users often miss payment due dates, thus incurring penalties and interest charges, while also failing to take full advantage of the various benefits and rewards offered by their cards. This can lead to financial stress and a less-than-optimal use of credit resources. Consequently, users need a convenient solution to keep track of all their credit card details in one place, which can help them manage their finances better and utilize their credit cards more efficiently.

### Solution:

Enter the Credit Card Manager, an innovative app designed to simplify the process of managing multiple credit cards. This user-friendly app allows you to view all your credit cards in one centralized location, making it easy to monitor your balances, due dates, and benefits. The app notifies you when you have a balance due, ensuring you never miss a payment deadline again. Additionally, users can easily add, edit, and delete card information as needed. If your pay date or credit limit changes, you can quickly update the details in the app to reflect these changes accurately.

### The main features planned for implementation are:

* Sign-Up and Log-In: A secure sign-up and log-in process to protect user data and ensure privacy.

* Ability to List All Credit Cards: Users can view all their credit cards in one place, providing an at-a-glance overview of their financial status.

* Notifications for Balance Due Dates: The app sends notifications to remind users when a balance is due, helping to avoid late fees and interest charges.

* Options to Add, Edit, and Delete Credit Card Information: Users can manage their credit card details with ease, including the ability to add new cards, update existing card information, or remove cards that are no longer in use.

* Flexibility to Update Changes: The app provides the flexibility to update changes from your bank, such as new pay dates or credit limits, ensuring that your credit card information is always current.

* By integrating these features, the Credit Card Manager app aims to alleviate the difficulties associated with managing multiple credit cards, providing users with a streamlined and efficient tool to take control of their finances. This will ultimately lead to improved financial health, better utilization of credit card benefits, and reduced stress related to managing multiple credit accounts.
